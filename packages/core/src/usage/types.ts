// Usage data: how much every agent has actually spent, read out of the

//
// Exactness rules every producer and consumer here follows:
// - Token counts are integers and are only ever added, never scaled.
// - Money is integer picodollars (usageMoney.ts), carried as decimal strings.
// - A period is [from, to): inclusive start, exclusive end, in epoch ms. A
//   request exactly at local midnight belongs to the day that starts there.
// - Every request lands in exactly one row of every breakdown, so each
//   breakdown's rows sum to the report's totals — asserted in the tests.
