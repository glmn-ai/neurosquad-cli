// The plug-in point for everything the Usage section reads.

// A source knows one harness's (or one provider's) log format and turns it
// into normalised, de-duplicated `UsageRecord`s. The index
// (usageIndex.ts) owns scheduling, the on-disk cache and attribution to
// agents; a source only answers "what requests are there".
//
// To add one (OpenRouter, a new harness): implement `UsageSource` and hand it
// to `registerUsageSource` in usageIndex.ts — or, for a provider that learns
// about requests as they happen rather than from a log, use `PushSource`
// below and call its `add`.
