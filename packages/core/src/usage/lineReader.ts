// Incremental, byte-exact reading of an append-only JSONL log.
//
// The logs the Usage section reads are appended to while the harness runs,
// so a scan usually meets a file whose last line is still being written.
// Only COMPLETE lines are consumed: the cursor stops right after the last
// newline, and the unfinished tail is read again, whole, next time. (The
// earlier reader advanced past that tail and so never parsed the line it cut
// in half — one request lost per unlucky scan.)
//
// Splitting happens on the newline BYTE, before decoding: a chunk boundary
// can fall inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character, and decoding each chunk on
// its own would mangle it.
